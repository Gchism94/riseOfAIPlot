# Rise of AI Plot Reproduction

This project was conducted to test my `ggplot2` skills in reproducing [**The rise of artificial intelligence over the last 8 decades**](https://ourworldindata.org/brief-history-of-ai)plot by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/). The plot has some slight differences based on the data used in my version vs the original.

The original plot is licensed under [**CC-BY**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) by the authors Charlie Giattino, Edouard Mathieu, and Max Roser.

The data is taken from Sevilla, Lennart Heim, Anson Ho, Tamay Besiroglu, Marius Hobbhahn, Pablo Villalobos (2022) -- [Compute Trends Across Three eras of Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05924.pdf). Published in arXiv on March 9, 2022. The data are [freely available](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AAIebjNsnJj_uKALHbXNfn3_YsT6sHXtCU0q7OIPuc4/edit#gid=0) to the public.
